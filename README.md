Fine-grained scene understanding in the context of 3D point clouds for the railway environment carries enormous economic values, 
but its development is severely limited by the lack of suitable and specific datasets. 
Besides, the models trained on existing urban road point cloud datasets exhibit poor generalization on railway data because of a large domain gap caused by non-overlapped special/rare categories,
e.g., rail track, track bed, etc. To unleash the potential of supervised deep learning algorithms in the area of 3D railway scene understanding, 
we present a new point cloud benchmark, dubbed Rail3D, with large-scale richly annotated points for semantic segmentation in the railway environment. 
Specifically, Rail3D has not only 2 times the number of labeled points of the existing largest mobile laser scanning (MLS) point cloud dataset, 
but also is the first railway-specific 3D dataset for semantic segmentation. It covers a total of nearly 25 km railway in two different scenes (urban and mountain), 
with 3 billion points that are finely labeled as 11 most typical classes w.r.t railway, and the data acquisition process is completed in China by MLS systems. 
Experimentally, we extensively evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art scene understanding algorithms on our dataset and provide a comprehensive analysis of the results. 
Based on that, we identify several key challenges towards railway-scale point cloud understanding. We will release our dataset upon paper acceptance and continually update it with usage feedback from the community.
